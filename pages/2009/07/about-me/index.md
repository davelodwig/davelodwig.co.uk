Hi, i'm Dave Lodwig a Software Engineer based in Gloucestershire and this is my website where I write about the sometimes bizarre things I get myself involved in.

I like to build things, make pictures, run, cycle, sleep in tents, climb up mountains for no good reason and eat food cooked on a camp fire.Â  I'm a Scout having joined Beaver Scouts at seven years old and haven't left yet although I've changed groups a couple times. Currently I'm the Group Scout Leader at Eastcombe Scout & Guide group in Stroud.

## Bicycles And All That

Even though I can drive I've not had much luck with cars, just ask my friends about my history with Renault Scenic's. For general transportation I rely on bicycle power and can often be seen cycling between Stroud and Cheltenham.

I post semi regularly on Instagram follow me [here](https://instagram.com/davelodwig/) or on this site.
