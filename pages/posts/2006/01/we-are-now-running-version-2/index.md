I had a few moments of free time this afternoon so I decided to take a proper look at version 2.0 of Wordpress. Well I am happy to confirm that the site is now running version 2.0. At the moment all of my plugins seem to be working and the custom fields I use to handle the photography section still work.

I'll post a full review after I have clicked every link and fiddled with every setting but at the moment I am very happy with it overall, especially the new editor.
