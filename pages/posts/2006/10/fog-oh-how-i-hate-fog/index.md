When I managed to rouse myself this morning I looked out the window to see the cyclists nightmare, FOG. Motorists don't look where they are going in good visability, let alone when they can't see very far. I tooled up with no less that four blinky lights to try and improve my chances of survival.

When I first started spinning out around 200 miles a week on the bike, I was quite positive but now I realise that the odds are against me and It's not so much a case of if I get hit by a car but when, I currently reckon about once every two months for a minor bump of knock down and I'm yet to have a major accident. Funny how I spend my breakfast pondering my chances of making it to work alive while other people watch the news and talk to their kids.
