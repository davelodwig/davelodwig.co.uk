It's official, I'm going to be performing visuals at Drop Beats not Bombs on November 8th at the Rainbow in Digbeth.Â  I'm just waiting to hear which set I'm going to be doing but hopefully it'll either be some awesome breaks or some nice chilled out electronica.

You can find the full line up at [www.dropbeatsnotbombs.co.uk](http://www.dropbeatsnotbombs.co.uk "Drop Beats Not Bombs") tickets are Â£10 and well worth the money.
