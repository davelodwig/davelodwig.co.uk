So I was catching up with my twitter feed from today after eating a quite scrummy tea cooked by my sweetie and this tweet popped up from the UK Contingent twitter feed

> 6 months today, everyone will have spent their first night back home after their WSJ Experience... Start thinking now about what's next!

Is it worrying that I'm working on programe and projects that are taking place next year, and laying plans for even further away. Â Is it me being organised, or am I just a little bit mad.

If you fancy a peek at what the Jamboree unit here in Birmingham are up to check out our website at [http://www.brumjambo.org.uk](http://www.brumjambo.org.uk)
