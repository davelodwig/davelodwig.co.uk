I think you can divide theÂ earth'sÂ populousÂ into some distinct groups,

Those who just stand there ...

Those who watch ...

Those that DO ...

I'm pretty sure that I'm one of the ones that does!

That's a bold statement, butÂ I'veÂ got the scars, the hair loss, and the rings around my eyes from putting in the hours to make things happen. Â I think I should change the tag line on my business cards to "I Do Amazing Things".

Hold on to your hats.
