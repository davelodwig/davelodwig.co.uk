It's just nobody's told the road haulage association.

Eventually the oil will run out , there is no escaping that single fact. Â It's not a renewable resource and we might as well face the fact. Â But there is a transport solution for moving cargo and it's ...

The railways

Yep, someÂ companiesÂ are already doing it but a single train can haul more cargo than any lorry alone, and guess what we can make practical electric trains that could be powered by anÂ enormousÂ combination of types of generated electricity.

If only the government had the impetus ... never mind the tories are in power.
