This weekend i'm heading down to Gilwell Park for the yearly reunion, which is the leaders bash put on by the Scout association.Â  As it's the centenery year I'm fully expecting it to be packed to the rafters with leaders from all over the UK and the rest of the world.Â  I usually go to try and get my hands on some really solid programme ideas, sometimes I manage it sometimes I don't.

I picked up a new phone today, a shiny HTC S7100 (rebadged as an Orange SPV 3650)Â  Ive loaded on PhoneSharpMT as lifeblog from the nokia won't run on it.Â  While I'm at Gilwell I may make a few posts just to try the thing out.
