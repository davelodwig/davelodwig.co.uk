Well as I can kinda communicate and the coughing fits seem to have ceased, I'm going back to work tomorrow.Â  Not on the bike however, I shall take the bus and wrap up warm.Â  Hopefully then I can survive the first day back at the office without dying.

As I'm no longer officially infectious, form an orderly line ladies.
