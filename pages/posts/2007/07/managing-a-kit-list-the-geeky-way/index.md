So normally I would get up the morning before camp and pack my gear on the fly, no kit list. Just grab a bag and stuff a few changes of clothes into it. In fact some of the gear would probably be in a pile from the last camp. However the Jamboree requires a more planned approach given the fact I need to pack for three weeks. So using excel I took a basic list produced by Fitz from the suggestions on the web and modified the spreadsheet to include status indicators for gear and pack so I can track what items I still need to buy and what's been packed and what hasn't.

OK so it's geeky but otherwise I might forget something.
