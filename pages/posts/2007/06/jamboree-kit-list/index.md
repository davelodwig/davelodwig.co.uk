We have somewhere in the region of 40 days till the IST have to report to check in on the Jamboree site and I have no idea what kit to take with me. I understand the fact that I will be sleeping in a tent for almost 3 weeks and that space is quite limited as we have to carry our gear from the drop off point to the adult sub camp. A distance they reckon should take 30 to 45 minutes to walk. So far I have the following items.

- Large Duffel to put everything in.
- Daysack
- Tent
- Sleeping Bag
- Toothbrush
- IST polo shirts & neckercheif

I need to work on the list a bit I think.
