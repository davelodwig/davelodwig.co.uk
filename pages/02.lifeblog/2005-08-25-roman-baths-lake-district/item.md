Roman settlement stretched as far down from Hadrian's Wall along this coast, and Ravenglass was a key Roman settlement area. The remains of the bath house of the Roman fort of Ravenglass, which was established in AD130, are extremely well-preserved.

The walls stand almost 4 metres (13ft) high. Ravenglass was a key naval base for the Romans and the walls of the fort's bath house are among the most complete in Roman Britain.
