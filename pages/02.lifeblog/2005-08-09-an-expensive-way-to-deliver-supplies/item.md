Every Thursday the helicopter makes deliveries to the Frundenhutte located at 2652 metres on the edge of the Frunden glacier in the Bernese Oberland. Everything that the hut needs to operate is delivered this way including fuel, firewood, food and drink, and even the water. This of course has a knock on effect on prices, at this altitude a glass of cola can cost you 7 Swiss Francs (Â£3.50).
