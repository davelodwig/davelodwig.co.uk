There may be some people out there in the blogging community who posted at exactly midnight but to be honest I could barely stand up, let alone use a computer so it was probably best that I didn't.

**New Years Resolutions** Now really if youre going to do something, do it! don't wait for a special time of year. But it is a bit of fun to lighten the mood a touch so here we go.

1. Loose Weight - Yep this year i'm gonna stop beating around the bush and get my slimline figure of 1996 back.
2. Climb More - Can you do enough climbing.
3. Have a proper relationship - I guess it's about time.
4. Enjoy My Birthday - This year i'm 26, and theres nothing I can do about it. So I better just have some fun.

**Finally ...**

Happy New Year Everybody!
