My iPod broke. It's a flaming disaster, first the hard disk died and I managed to reserrect that! Then the buttons stopped working. Right now all I can do is use the headphone remote to start the tracks playing.

What this means is that right now I need a new MP3 player. In the running right now are

- iRiver T10 (1024MB or 2048MB) [(link)](http://www.iriver.eu.com/flash_player.html?p_id=352&L=0&view=&PHPSESSID=e347e20aad63ad805145ce071a0a299c "iRiver T10")
- iAudio U3 (1024MB or 2048MB) [(link)](http://eng.iaudio.com/product/product_U3_feature.php "iAudio U3")

Youll notice that these are both flash memory devices rather than hard disk based ones, I think after hammering the crap out of my ipod ive learnt my lesson.
