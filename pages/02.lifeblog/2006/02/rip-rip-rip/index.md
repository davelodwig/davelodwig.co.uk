For the last couple of days I've been re ripping my entire CD collection after the loss of my iPod.  The CD's I don't mind it's the odd tracks collected over the last 5 years that I'm gonna miss.  It's strange but at work and with my documents I'm always backing up. But my music collection, not a backup in sight.

I guess this is one hell of a lesson.
