Everyones back up from the opening ceremony now and having a hot drink in our camp.

We had a few problems with the space we were allocated but managed to set up a pretty decent camp. I have only put some of the flags on the gate but we'll finish it off tommorow.

Tommorow the kids are on on site activities so a nice relaxed start to the camp, no early morning.

Best bit of today laughing so hard I almost wet myself at the break dancing Scout and my Scouts amusing dance moves.
