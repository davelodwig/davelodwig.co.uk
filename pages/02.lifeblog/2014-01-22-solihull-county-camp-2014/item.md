At the first County Exec of 2014 last night Paul our camp leader unveiled the plans so far to the meeting. Â I'm pleased to say it's looking really good. Not only are we on a site inside the County, but the beginnings of the programme are looking awesome, with plenty for everyone to do.

Paul's team have now been given the go-ahead from the Exec to ramp up the work and make their plans a reality, and create what I hope will be a truly amazing experience for all our wonderful Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Explorers, Leaders and Helpers.
