It's hard growing up listening to Radio 4 and not having a Desert Island Disks playlist in your head somewhere just in case they call to ask you on the programme. So for your enjoyment here is mine.

**1. Martha Reeves & The Vandellas - Nowhere To Run.**

One of the first tracks we hear in anger on Good Morning Vietnam, and a track that never fails to get my feet tapping and my pulse racing.

**2. Frank Turner - Eulogy.**

Short and too the point, a song that says how I feel about life in general and I know all the words.

**3. Kate Rusby - Awkward Annie.**

I like a lot of folk but I especially like the dancy quick moving type. I've been in love with this track from the first time I heard it live.

**4. Megadeath - Tout Le Monde.**

Classic metal delivered well, another track I can't help but sing along too.

**5. Owl City & Carly Rae Jepsen - Good Time.**

Owl city came into my life during the run up to the 2011 Jamboree when one of the kids was playing a track from the album out of the time. I got my hands on the other albums and this track is really a fun pop song that puts a smile on my face.

**6. Guns N' Roses - Sweet Child O' Mine.**

One of the first rock songs I was exposed too on a tape made by a friend at school. Â The tape contained a number of classics but I can't help but sing along when this comes on.

**7. Muse - Stockholm Syndrome.**

The hairs on my arms stand on end the moment I hear the opening to this track. A feature in many of my early running playlists and always caused me to run a little faster.

**8. David Ford - Panic.**

David Ford has so many awesome tracks but I picked this one because I really like how it's strung together and despite the downbeat message it lifts me up when I hear it.

Could I choose one of these tracks to be the only one I take with me, well probably no as there is hundreds of tracks I'd choose I mean I've not even put any dance, or break beats on the list. 8 tracks is simply not enough but then I wonder if my iPod would be allowed as my luxury item?
