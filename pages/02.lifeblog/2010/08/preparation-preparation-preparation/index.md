Things are coming together nicely, although I've brought down a spare fleece and shirt after looking at the forecast. Â I've swapped my hammock and tarp I was going to bivi with for my lightweight mountain tent.

I'm still worried about something going wrong, but as least I can just put the tent up and go to sleep if everything goes wrong and wait until the busses and trains start running or I can call for a rescue mission from someone.
