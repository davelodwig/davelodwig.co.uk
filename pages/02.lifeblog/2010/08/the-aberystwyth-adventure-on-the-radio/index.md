I didn't post this on Saturday morning as I was concentrating on getting everything ready but my friend Julia mentioned me on her show onÂ RhubarbÂ Radio.

[Heres the linky](http://thebigpaws.co.uk/2010/08/the-big-paws-28082010-%E2%80%94-listen-again/)

I'm mentioned just after the mgmt track.

Just a little update, I'm planning to attempt this again, and to take on the coast to coast non stop.
