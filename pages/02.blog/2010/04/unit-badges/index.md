I ordered custom badges for the first time today, If it sounds geeky well i'm afraid it is.

In fact what I actually did was order 2000 fundraising badges for the Jamboree Unit and 500 unit only badges. The badges are being produced by a local firm called Tolley Badges from a design by the very talented Chris Murray.

I bet your wondering why I haven't posted an image, it's because I'm making you wait till I have them in my hands.
