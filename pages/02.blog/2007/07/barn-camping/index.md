We arrived in Essex around 5.30 after a rather trouble free trip. However the weather did follow us and our arrival at Spinningdale Farm seemed to coincide with the rain arriving.

Fitz's uncle and antie provided us with a cracking tea and a trip to their Millienium stone. As it was still raining we were given digs in a dutch barn complete with wood pigeons.
