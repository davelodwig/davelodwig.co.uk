Sometime early yesterday morning my website and email accounts vanished from the Internet. The cause turned out to be scrambled DNS settings caused by moving the domain registar from my prevous and now non-exisitant one to the very cheap and good 123reg.

Thankfully the problem only effected my personal site davelodwig.co.uk, none of the other properties including my clients were effected by this.

Full service resumed around 16.00 GMT.
