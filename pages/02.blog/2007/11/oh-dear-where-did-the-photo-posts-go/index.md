A while ago when I switched from my Nokia N70 to the SPV E650 I'm using now I realised that the Lifeblog software that I used during the Jamboree wouldn't work any more. The options for smartphone users seem to be decidedly stark on this front, although the useful PhoneSharp fills a hole it lacks the ability to resize pictures and create thumbnails. Or if it does Ive not found it.

What I need is a really good tool similar to the Nokia Lifeblog app but designed for Wordpress that would run on a smartphone. Maybe this is an excuse to break out the development tools again.
