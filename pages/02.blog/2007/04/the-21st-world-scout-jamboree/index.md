In 100 days 32,000 scouts and guide from 216 countries will descend upon Hylands Park in Chelmsford, Essex for the 21st World Scout Jamboree.Â Â  So as i'm to old to be a participant I have enlisted as a member of the International Sevice Team, an 8000 (hopefully) strong international team of leaders, fellowship and network who have the job of making the Jamboree happen.Â  We are as descibed by the organisers the "Engine Room".

A lot of people have made comments that the organisers are ripping off the IST by charging so much for our camp fees (Â£550) and I have to agree it's a lot of money for 3 weeks hard work, but as I never got the chance to take part when I was a Scout and it's the Centenary I wasn't prepared to miss it.
