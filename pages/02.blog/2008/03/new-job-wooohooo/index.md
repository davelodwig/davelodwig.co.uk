I've waited a bit to make sure everything is properly squared away before announcing this properly but after 3 years I am leaving the council and heading off to pastures new.

I have accepted an offer at a company called [Delcam](http://www.delcam.co.uk) as a Systems Support Engineer and start on the 31st of March.  The jobs mostly a programming role with a touch of systems support thrown in for good measure.  I'm sure I'm gonna have a great time and it's only down the road from my scout hut.
