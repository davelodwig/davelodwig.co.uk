After a week of burning the candle at both ends and in the middle, the curtain went up at the X-Lab:VL show at Concrete.Â  Right now I'm far too knackered to make any sense but my photos are [here.](http://www.davelodwig.co.uk/photos/album/2008-projectxpresents-xlabvl/)Â  The next shows in June so if you missed this one keep your eyes open.
