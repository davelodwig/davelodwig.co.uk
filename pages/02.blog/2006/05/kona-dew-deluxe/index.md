After thrashing my 8 year old Scott Apache Hardtail to death I finally got round to upgrading to something a little more suitable for my daily commute.  Armed with my trusty debit card I took a trip to Pro Bike in Kings Heath and got my hands on a Kona Dew Deluxe and then in the eyes of some ruined it by having mudguards and a expedition rack fitted to it.  I'm still getting comfortable with it but I runs real nice and weighs almost nothing and should I hope help me start cutting down my commute time.

I fill you guys in more once I've been out playing.
