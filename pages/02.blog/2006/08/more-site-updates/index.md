In the last hour I have enabled the link between my currently empty flickr account and the site. Currently the photolog is still active and will still remain so. The random picture comes from there. I'mjust using flickr instead of hosting my own photo gallery, now I should be able to upload from iPhoto directly after buying the add-on.
