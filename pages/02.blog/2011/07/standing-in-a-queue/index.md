In the run up to the jamboree they’ve been trying to convince us to use the I’d card or bank cards to pay at the Jamboree. While still stating we could still use cash. The truth appears to be now that very few places here take cash everywhere pretty much need you to use your ID badge or bank card. So I’m standing in a massive queue to put money on my card.

I guess this counts as an afternoon activity.
