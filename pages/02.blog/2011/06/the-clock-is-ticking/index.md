38 days to go to the Jamboree! Â 38 days till departure morning. Â Am I nervous... yes. Â I've got a lot to do, a lot to organise and pack, and not a lot of time to do it. Â I'm excited, and I'm excited for the young people we are taking with us but I'm trying to focus on the things that need doing to make sure our trip goes without a hitch.

But first I need to get though District Camp this weekend.
