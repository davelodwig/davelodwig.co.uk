This morning when I stepped on my scales the reading was dead on 100KG.

Whoop!!

Apparently according to another blog post in November I now need to buy some clothes from Howies. Â To be fair, I think I might wait a little longer and hold out for the single speed bicycle I promised myself when I reached 90KG. Â Not sure how Briony might feel about that considering I've only just had a new bicycle in Febuary and I'm off to Sweden for 3 weeks really soon.

Since November my focus has really changed, back then I needed to bribe myself and didn't imagine I'd be living with the most fantastic person. Â It's taken me 6 months to shift 7 Kilos, lets see if we can do 10 kilos in 10 weeks and be 90 Kilos in time for the Jamboree.

Right, back to it.
