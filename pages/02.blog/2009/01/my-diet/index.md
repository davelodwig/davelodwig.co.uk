![Combined Diet Chart Jan 09](images/combined.jpg "Combined Diet Chart Jan 09")

So the latest update on my journey with my diet, which Is a cross between Weight Watchers for men and some software add-ons I have written in Excel and PHP Â (Yeh a real mish mash). Â My weight is down to 103.9 KG from a starting point of 118 KG and my waist measurment is now at 113 CM. Â That equates to just under 16.4 Stone in old money from just over 18.5 Stone.
