I'm in Edinburgh for the last weekend of the fringe festival and I was kinda hoping I might come across a steel touring frame for aÂ bargainÂ price while I was up here. Â I've had a bit of a mooch about and visited a car boot sale on the bottom floor of an underground multi-story car park, but alas no frame so far.

I'm heading homeÂ tomorrow and I'm going to have to continue my search for a frame for my bargain bombproof touring bike frame on the Internet.
