Ok, so I havn't posted for a while. But I do hope to spend a bit more time on the site in the future. I have just finished tweaking the design a little, the headers had changed slightly as well as some mods in the photography category.

Over the next week or so i'll finish modding the photo section and touch up the pages as well as add a whole pile of stuff there.

Keep checking back and please no more insulting comments about me, especially you kids from Five Ways (Yes I can trace an IP address.)
