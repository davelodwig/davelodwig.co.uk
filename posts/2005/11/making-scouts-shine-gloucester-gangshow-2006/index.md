2 megawatts of electricity, 65 theatrical lanterns, 300 metres of TRS , 100 square metres of coloured gel, five people, and a week of limted sleeping. Put All that lot together and you get the Gloucester Gangshow lighting crew. It seems like it wasn't that long ago, (9 months in fact) when I packed everything away and now with the arrival of the scripts the work has started again. In April next year I will turn up at the Bacon Theatre in Cheltenham with a set of plans a huge pile of hired equipment and 72 hours to get it into place for the dress rehersal.

I guess the old addage sticks if your tired, covered in muck, slightly electrocuted, and quite possibly drunk. Then your a lighting tech.
