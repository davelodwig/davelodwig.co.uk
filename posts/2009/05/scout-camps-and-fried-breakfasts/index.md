I used to be one of those chaps who could pretty much eat anything they turned a fancy to, but these days it seems I just have to look sideways at a cooked breakfast and my internal organs do a double take and tie themselves in knots. Â It's not plesant, I get wind, belching and quite often stomach cramps. I figure it's from the grease involved in cooking but I could be wrong. Either way I'm having weetabix for breakfast today. I may have to take a bumper box of cereal to summer camp or I could actually die.

Xx
