Off on the Fellowship ramble today, starting at the Green Man in Harbourne. I've packed the Brompton as I'm off to the Adam & Eve after for an all night mission and need to get home.

Should be fun, if I'm lucky a couple pints of good beer a bit of a boogie and maybe a house party but you never know.
