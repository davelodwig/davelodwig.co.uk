In 2012 The Scout Association County of Birmingham is holding an International Jamboree called BrumJAM. Â It's being held at our county scout activity centre Blackwell Adventure and is open to 1500 Scouts & Guides from all over the world (including Birmingham).

I've been appointed as Head of Entertainment and it's my remit to plan and deliver all of the Entertainment, the technical aspects for them and organise and produce the opening and closing ceremonies. Â So just a little job then. Â There's a long way to go and at the moment I'm in the process of asking people to be a part of the core entertainments team who will be helping me to do theÂ initialÂ planning and organising before we start recruiting the larger team of technical staff, performers, and external groups.

All this on top of running a Scout Troop and attending the 22nd WSJ, I must be mad.
