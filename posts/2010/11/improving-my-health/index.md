As many of you know I cycle ... A lot. Â But I'm still not terribly happy with the state of my health the term I heard described was a great little aerobic engine in a crap chassis.

So heres my plan, I'm using a great little website [http://www.myfitnesspal.com](http://www.myfitnesspal.com) to monitor and track my food intake which seems to be working really well and my weight seems to be in a nice downward direction. Â They also have an iPhone app which means I have no excuse not to record what I'm eating.

To complement the cycling I'm always doing I've also started running. Â I'm using the Runners World beginners course and building up and hopefully I can stick to it as It's something I've wanted to do for a long time.

As a motivational tool, i've set myself some little targets to encourage myself.

Right now I'm 107 Kilos (16.89 Stone)

When I get below 100 kilos (15.74 Stone) I intend to buy myself some clothes from Howies.

When I get below 90 kilos (14.17 Stone) I'm buying a new single speed bicycle.

When I get below 70 Kilos (11.24 Stone) Well when I get there I'll think of something.

The good thing is I'm excited about the whole thing and even looking forward to my runÂ tomorrowÂ morning.
