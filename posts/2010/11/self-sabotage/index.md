I wish ...

That i didn't always wear my heart on my sleeve and bear my scars for all to see.

That I didn't always manage to screw up the few good things that come my way.

 

I'm angry with myself ...

because at 30 years old I should know better and play things cool until the time is right.

 

I'm scared ...

because I don't want to end up knowing I didn't try.
