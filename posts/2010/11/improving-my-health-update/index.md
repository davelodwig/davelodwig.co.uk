A friend of mine Charlie commented on my last post and pointed out that 70 kilos was probably a bit stick like. Â So in view of that and following her advice, and she's seen me almost barn dance myself to death; I've changed my final target to 80 kilos.

Or at least until we get there, then we will play it by ear.

So 80 Kilos means 26.5 Kilos to loose when I get there I will buy myself a nice weekend away somewhere that doesn't involve Scouts in anyway, ok so it' might involve some friends who are part of Scouts but no small children.
