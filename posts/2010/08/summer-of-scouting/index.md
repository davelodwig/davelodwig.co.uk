I've been back from Bucks100fest for a little under a day now, and I'm starting work again on my other projects and getting back into the Jamboree Stuff I need to get done.

My Scouting summer started with a weeks summer camp at Peak 2010, and while the kids did seem to have a good time they seemed very bogged down in rules and regulations. Â We even had a kitchen inspection and where questioned about how we intended to cook the kids food. Â They weather wasn't very kind to us and the closing ceremony was almost cancelled due to the rain.

From Peak I headed back to Birmingham to drop off the kit, and then on to Buckinghamshire to ChalfontÂ HeightsÂ campsite for the Buckinghamshire Guide centenary camp Bucks100Fest. Â I arrived fashionably late but in time to do a bit of car parking, something that I repeated a few times. Â As a Bucket I lifted, shifted andÂ patrolledÂ at all hours of the day and even sat in the sun and ate ice cream. Â I lay on the floor next to a security barrier with Jess crushing my legs and guides sticking glowsticks up my nose during a fire poi demonstration and Hi-Fived so much my hands actually hurt. Â And when it was all finished we ripped it all out packed it into vans and cleared up, but only after having a staff party.

I've got a few days to myself now and it's a bitÂ weirdÂ being sat at home in the quiet after the hustle and bustle of the last two weeks, but I need to concentrate on finding somewhere to live now.

Oh yeah and does anyone have some nail polish remover I could borrow.
