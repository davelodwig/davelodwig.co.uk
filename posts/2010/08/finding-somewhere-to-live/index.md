Well after a bit of searching and looking at some overpriced inner city apartments I've found some digs in near Birmingham Airport. Â It's just a two bedroom affair so none of my current mansionesque luxury but big enough for me and some of my stuff. Â This is of course a fab excuse for a clear down of all my stuff and getting rid of some of the junk I have been carrying about thats not even been unpacked since I moved to Aldridge. Â I'd look out for someÂ reasonableÂ house items appearing on Walsall freegle soon.
