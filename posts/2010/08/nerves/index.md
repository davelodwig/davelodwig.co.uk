Todays the day I set off on the Aberystwyth Adventure 110 miles overnight by Brompton Bicycle.

I'm bricking it!

I was fine last night while I was finishing the route planning and gathering up kit but I've woken up this morning with a right uneasy feeling; I'm worried that a wheel will fall off, i'll get hit by a truck, or simply there won't be water at any of the stealth bottle refuelling points I'veÂ identified.

I'm sure once I get up and start the last prep on the bike and putting the last bits together I'll be fine and this timeÂ tomorrowÂ I'll be sitting in Aberystwyth drinking a coffee and eating an ice cream or sleeping in my bivi bag under a sand dune.
