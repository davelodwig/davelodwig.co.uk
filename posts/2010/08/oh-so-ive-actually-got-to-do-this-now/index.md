Right now the bikes packed and I'm drinking that final cup of tea before I head out of the door to the Council House in Birmingham for the start of the Aberystwyth Adventure.

Nervous, yes!

I have a train ticket waiting at Aberystwyth station for a reserved seat on the 13.30 to Birmingham tomorrow. If you fancy a laugh come meet me it gets in to new street at 16.37
