I was thinking about the upcoming Aberystwyth Adventure and how I should maybe set myself a target amount to raise doing it. Well I thought at first maybe I should set my target at Â£1800 which is what it costs for somebody to attend the Jamboree next year. That may be setting my sights a bit high so I've decided to set my target at Â£500

Â£500 is roughly 28% of the cost of sending someone to the Jamboree.
