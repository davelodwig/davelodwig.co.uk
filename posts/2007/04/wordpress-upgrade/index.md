I have just upgraded the site to the "Latest and Greatest" version of wordpress which is 2.1.3 the whole process was completly painless unlike the time I deleted my wp-config file during the upgrade.Â  I'm still geting used to the extra dibs and dabs in the admin interface but on the whole it looks good.
