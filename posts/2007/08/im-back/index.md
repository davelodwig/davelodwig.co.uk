Things have been a little hectic since the Jamboree, for a start there was the whole returning to work thing.Â  If that wasn't a shock enough I then had agreed to help out at the working party at the scout hut.Â  The upside is of course that the Scout Hut is now nice and shiny ready for the new term.

OK much to do so little time .
