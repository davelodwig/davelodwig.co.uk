Well it's almost over, in two days time the closing ceremony wil be held at the arena and the world scout flag will be lowered and sent on it's way to sweden.

Even though my job allows me time to get plenty of sleep, im starting to feel a little drained now. Thankfully it's my day off tommorow and I intend to head to Chelmsford so I can see the Simpsons movie and get away from the hustle and bustle just briefly enough to ground myself.

Mat, Becky, and Beth came out to visit yesterday unfortuantly I was working in the afternoon so our time was short.

The Swedish contingent have bribed me with a few goodies so I may well be off to Sweden in 2011.
