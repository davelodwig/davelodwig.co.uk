The weather if anyone didn't notice has taken a slight downturn this evening with some awesomely heavy rain and the loudest thunder I have heard in a long time. The lightning lit up the kitchen fairly bright just through the gaps in the blinds.

On this basis all the extreme weather gear I had struck from my kit list is now back in, so replacing my bright yellow cag is a Buffalo shirt and Karrimor Mountain Jacket. As well as my trusty just re-proofed Tilly hat. The problem is the gear I'm now taking dosn't all fit into the cargo bag I picked up.

At the moment the bag situation looks like this

- 120 Litre Cargo Bag
- 40 Litre Mule
- 25 Litre Daysak
- Tent bag and bits.

God only knows how I'm going to carry all of that to to the adult campsite!

On a non Jamboree note somehow I managed to tear the rear tyre on the Kona.
