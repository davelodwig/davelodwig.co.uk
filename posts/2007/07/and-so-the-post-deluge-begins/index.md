According to my calculations there are now just over 10 days to go till I have to report at the the North Weald check in desk with enough gear to survive three weeks of tented accomodation ... and I havn't even started packing!Â  I have a kit list which will be posted here in due course, once I have removed the items I don't really need from it.

My intention is to post once a day for the next 10 days and during the duration of theÂ  Jamboree, this will mostly be achived via the usual wordpress trickery whilst still lurking at home and via the lifeblog software on my mobile whilst away.Â  Be on the look out for some random twittering as well (I'm on twitter as davelodwig, surprisingly).Â  Hopefully my homemade solar charging arrangement will provide enough power to keep my venerable nokia ticking over whilst away.

For those of you wanting to post letters to me whilst i'm on site you can use the following address

David Lodwig Adult Camping Area 21st World Scout Jamboree Hylands Park Essex CM2 8WG

or use the usual email / phone number.

and finally some useful links
