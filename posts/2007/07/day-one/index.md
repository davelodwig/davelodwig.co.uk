Arrival and check-in was quite unstressful, I was greeted by a mad Scot complete with kilt and am a proud owner of an IST necker which is lurid to say the least.

I foolishly volunteered to help in the canteen and ended working a 6 hour shift restocking serverys good fun and people but hard and hot work.

The queue for breakfast this morning went from the canteen to the toilet block which is about 600 metres and it took around 30 mins to get served plus time to get a cuppa. Right now my training at the canteen has been delayed as they are still serving breakfast. ttfn.
