... All Bar The Screaming.

So the Mule was the first to be completed and zipped up, followed by the almost completion of the Cargo which is just waiting for my toothbrush and shaving gel.

Here is the plan for getting to the Jamboree as it stands as of now in the middle of the night.

1. Friday (Afternoon) _Leave work early to change and double check my gear._
2. Friday (Evening) _Head to Blackwell Court with Fitz for a few days R&R and getting used to the amount of stuff I'm going to be carrying to the campsite._
3. Sunday _Laura arrives at Blackwell, the three of us stop over on Sunday night._
4. Monday (Morning) _Visit Mom and Dad in Tewkesbury and drop off some 2008 expedition cheques, and hopefully get a spot of lunch._
5. Monday (Afternoon) _Arrive at Billericay, Essex (Fitz's Uncle and Anties Place) and spend the night camping in their garden._
6. Tuesday (Morning, Quite Early) _Travel to North Wield and check in and hopefully find out my job role._

Ok I have to sleep now.

ttfn.
