**UKÂ ContingentÂ Arrive!**

Today the Explorer scouts and unit leaders from the UK arrived, so it rained and then it rained some more. The view is from the facilities tent where I work looking across the island hub during some of the really heavy rain. In the morning the rest of the world starts to arrive here in Hylands Park.
