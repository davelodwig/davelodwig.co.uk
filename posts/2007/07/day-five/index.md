The opening ceremony yesterday left me staggered I didn't cry as some did but over the afternoon the scale of what we are involved in began to sink in.

It rained last night so the mud was bad again this morning, our little beach on the island hub was completely flooded out.

The facilities tent was as always a muddy mess and some new wood chips where put down behind the desks. One of our e-pay machines also broke after filling with rainwater so a few people couldn't get mobile top ups. However the sun is shining and all is good except that it's laundry drop off day and we are about to be overrun.

ttfn.
