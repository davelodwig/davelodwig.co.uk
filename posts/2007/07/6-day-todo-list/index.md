It's now six days out from arrival and I'm running through the list of things I still need to do

1. Finish packing
2. Print contact details cards
3. Pick up some clear stickyback plastic.
4. Get troop photo taken and printed.
5. Grab a beer with friends and chill out before the hard work starts.
6. Visit my parents and get some photos printed.

I am kinda nervous as my final job role hasn't been announced yet, but I guess I'm gonna have to wait until I get to check in to find out.Â  Tonight is the yearly Scout Troop BBQ so hopefully a few burgers will settle my nerves.

ttfn.
