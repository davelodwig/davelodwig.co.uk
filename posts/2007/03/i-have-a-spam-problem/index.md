I'm not even here that often it seems nowadays but the spam bots seem to be content to send spam comments again and again and again. I deleted over 200 from the moderation queue this morning and my emails been blinking away all evening as wordpress reports that more comments need moderating.

Oh well at least their not making it onto the actual site.
