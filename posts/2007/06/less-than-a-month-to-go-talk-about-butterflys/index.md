32,000 Young People and Leaders, 8000 International Service Team, up to 12,000 day visitors, 29 days till the bulk of the IST start arriving.

And I have no idea what I am going to be doing.

The latest site map was release onto the UK Contingent website and the place is huge, when they said it could take an hour to walk from one end to the other they were not kidding. All of the units have an allocated campsite the IST just have a huge field with "Adult Camping Area" written on it. Hopefully I won't be too far from one of the Bar's.

Right back to working on my kit list.
