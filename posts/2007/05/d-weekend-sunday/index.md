It was raining when I got up, it was raining when I took down my tent. Generally it rained alot.

Free breakfast this morning provided by the ever cheery catering vans and then head off to the briefing. Which is the whole reason for being here. The briefing itself answered a whole load of questions and even provided answers for things I hadnt thought of.

Time to collect the gear, I had a small bag full. Fitz bought the shop!

Myself and junior got our gear packed and into Fitz's car and then sat in the dry and watched Fitz take forever taking his tent down in the rain. After that we headed back up the motorway with a quick stop at my folks for a cuppa and home by seven.

Got home broken and slightly damp but still had a jolly good time.
