This is a shot of the park near work where I come to think when I have a few things on my mind that need resolving. At this time of year it's a little to cold for the hordes of troublemakers so is a nice quiet place.

Iv'e been spending quite a few lunchtimes here of late as I have some big decisions to make concerning my career as it stands. Mostly whether I continue the path of corporate employment or move off and work on some more of my freelance projects.

Peace.
