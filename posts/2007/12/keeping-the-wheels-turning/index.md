This is an observation made on another site on the web, unfortunately I can't remember the address.

"If you ask a motorist if they would like to see more cars on the road, the answer is almost always NO"

"If you ask a cyclist if they would like to see more bicycles on the road, the answer is almost always YES"

Peace.
