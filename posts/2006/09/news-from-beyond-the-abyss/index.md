Ok so it's been ages and I mean ages since I last updated the site but hey, i'm only human. It's not like i'm some internet celebrity or anything so stop your whining.

**Flickr**

In the last post back in August I talked about how I had just enabled the flickr gallery plugin and my photos now appeared here, fantastic or what. Well after realising that flickr wanted 24.99 from me to be able to have more than 3 gallerys I decided to not bother and revamp another one of my internet properties. check out [www.secondcityjournal.co.uk](http://www.secondcityjournal.co.uk "Second City Journal") it's running gallery 2 and is far more upto date than my flickr account was.

**Old Friends**

A guy I used to work with when I was in schools Ben Richards has just changed his website again and is now running wordpress (about bloody time if you ask me), i'm sure the design will change every other month as seems to be his habit. Check it out at [www.benrichards.co.uk](http://www.benrichards.co.uk "Ben Richards"), he's got some really funny friends.

**2007 and Other Jamboree Stuff**

If you noticed the new category called "Scouting 2007" then you also probably noticed that it's empty, theres a reason for that I havn't written anything yet. Lets be truthfull I havn't written a whole lot of anything at all recently. Keep an eye out for news, photlogs, and other stuff here and at Second City Journal.

Thats it for now.
