So I was minding my own business cycling to cubs last night in the rain (and it wasn't that gentle good for making love in rain in either it was the heavy smash your teeth out rain).Â  And all around me the motorists seemed to have lost the plot, they were doing what normally would be considered crazy but in the wet just mental.Â  Overtaking so close that they could have got on the bike with me and just pretending they were in an F1 race even though the traffic was solid.

Crazy, just crazy.

I must admit I like cycling in the rain, no one will bother you that much and the rain stops you from getting too hot.Â  You just have to change when you get to your destination or enjoy stinking like a wet dog.
