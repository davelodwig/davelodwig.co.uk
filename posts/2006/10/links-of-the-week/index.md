In this weeks bag of link like goodness online mags, cycling rage and photo resources.

.citycycling - [http://www.citycycling.co.uk/](http://www.citycycling.co.uk/) Online cycling mag dedicated to cycling in the city, based in the UK as well to boot. Well worth reading if like me your commute is more interesting than sitting in a metal box.

Raging Bike - [http://www.ragingbike.co.uk/](http://www.ragingbike.co.uk/) Bike riders get road rage too, normally after almost being killed by a silly car driver. Some of the incidents scare me to death and some are quite funny. Don't start a fight post it here.

Morguefile - [http://www.morguefile.com/](http://www.morguefile.com/) Free and mostly royalty free stock photography, like iStockphoto but without the painful payment options. Just keep an eye on the quality of the stuff you download.

Thats it for this week, go to it.
