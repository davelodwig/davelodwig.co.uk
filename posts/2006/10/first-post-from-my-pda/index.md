This is the first post from my PDA, I’ve had the thing a while but never really used it to post. Mostly because it takes ages to type anything in. I managed to find a stowaway keyboard on Expansys for £4.50, these things are normally at least £50 mind you I did have to hack the thing to get it to fit my newer iPaq.

Oh well, now I’ve got to fix the PDA templates for my blog so that I can view the thing properly.
