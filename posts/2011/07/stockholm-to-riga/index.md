After the Jamboree itself the unit are off to Riga in Latvia for Home Hospitality. Â This involves a 17 hour ferry! Â I've just had a look though on google maps and the route is awesome, weaving through islands and around fjords on the swedish side for quite a long way before heading across the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Riga. Â And then heading right into the heart of the city.

Shame theres no google streetview in Latvia yet though.
