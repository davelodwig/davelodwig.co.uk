Today we headed out on camp in camp which was heralded as a traditional scouting experience. With the sun shining we headed down to the busses. After a two hour wait we caught a bus to our destination. Beautiful does not really begin to describe the place. We spent the first half an hour bathing in the lake followed by some crafts using antler horn. We took part in a walk through the forest which had check points which encouraged us to think about the surroundings we where in. At one check point we ate raspberries from the bushes around us.
