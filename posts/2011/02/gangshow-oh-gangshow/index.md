Well it's arrived already!  The hotly anticipated (tongue firmly in cheek you understand) East Birmingham Gangshow.  Today we spent what felt like an eternity transforming an unassuming school hall into the stage for the show.  The caretaker actually commented that she never sees that much stuff in the hall or the hall being that tidy.

I'll be spending the next week standing in my favorite place, behind the sound console.  I don't get to be sound engineer very often as everyone assumes I'm a lighting guy when in fact I'm a bit multipurpose me.

Anyway you can still get tickets if you fancy a nice night out.
