It's been just over a week since we got home from this years Spitfire Scout District Camp which I named Spitfire 24. Â I have only just about recovered.

Some time in the way back when I had this idea. Â I had seen good things about Gilwell 24 a camp for Explorer Scouts that runs for an entire 24 hour period and thought that it sounded like a great idea to strip down and run for the Scouts as a district camp. Except I don't think I really realised how long 24 hours actually is. Â My basic idea was that I would run the camp with a regular Friday night programme and then the 24 hour part would commence at breakfast on Saturday. I split the day up into 3.5 hour activity sessions and put bases on that would take 30 minutes (ish) to complete. Â More bases during the day and early evening and slightly less in the early morning as some of the Scouts would give up and go to sleep. Â I put a cinema on in a building on the site and held a midnight camp fire. Â Nick my DSL took the Scouts off for a wide game at 1 in the morning.

Overall the camp was a success, the kids had a great time and I've had some emails thanking me for running it. But I'm not sure If I want to stay up for 24 hours again, well not for a little while anyway.
