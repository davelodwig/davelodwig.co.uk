I'm not saying that I'm worried about our departure in 31 days because I'm not so worried. Â Theres very little that can be done short ofÂ becoming deadÂ now that will stop it happening. Â Might as well sit back relax and enjoy the ride.

However, the amount of information I've had to absorb is turning my brain to jelly, and not the good kind either. Â Briony got me to use a book as a mobile to do list and colour code each item by which pile it belonged to which has helped me empty my brain of all the things I need to do so I can just keep the useful facts in there. Â However the number of useful facts is now piling up. Â My head might actually explode.

I wonder if this is a tactic used by the UK Contingent to reduce the headcount.
