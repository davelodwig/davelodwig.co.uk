Ive been a bit quiet of late because I have been settling into life in my new job at Delcam PLC. But do not be concerned as I have been tinkering in the background.

A while back was the opening night of STRAX the audio visual show at Concrete in the jewelery quarter, I built and supplied a tagtool for the performance although I didn't get to use it that much as I was stuck up on the door making sure that people entered the competition and paid up to get in.

The tagtools quite a fun device to use and may get a bit of use over the coming months culminating in it's premiere event Project X Presents on June 14th.
