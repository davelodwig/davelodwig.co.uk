Wonder what the venue for the next Project X Presents show looks like before the madness starts?Â  You do! Fantastic.Â  We had the second of two visits to the venue last Wednesday and have sorted out some of the arrangements whilst there.Â  Theres going to be two rooms with our guests entering through the smaller downstairs "chill out"Â  space then moving up to the main room.Â  Dave Moore who is the appointed geezer in charge of the venue and one of our ace soundmen showed us around and even let us have a mooch in the beer store, mind you we were only looking at the electricity supply (Honest guv).

I've uploaded some photos from the first visit to my gallery here ...
