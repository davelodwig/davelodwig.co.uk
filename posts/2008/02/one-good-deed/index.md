I was attempting to de-ice the van this morning, so I could get to work.Â  The only problem being that rental vans don't contain any stuff for coping with this sort of weather.Â  As I struggled one of the guys that lives across the road from me came to my assistance with a handy can of de-icing spray.Â  Talk about life saver.
