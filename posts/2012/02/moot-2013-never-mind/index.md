Well the news was finally in yesterday, my second attempt to join the UK Contingent for the World Scout Moot in 2013 lay in tatters as I recived a very generic email.

> _Dear applicant,_
> 
> _Thank you for your recent application to join the Contingent Management Team for the World Scout Moot. I regret to inform you that we have received an unusually high number of applications and on this occasion we will not be able to take your application further._

There was some other text about other possibilities for IST, etc but to be honest after applying and interviewing for the Contingent Manager role and being turned down, and then applying and not even being interviewed for CMT I think my Moot adventure has come to an end. I just don't have the energy to pursue it any further, I could apply for IST but I don't think I could face being rejected a third time, added to which the two setbacks have knocked my enthusiasmÂ somewhat.

I spent some time yesterday afternoon feeling a little bit washed up, and wondering if I had reached the peak ofÂ opportunitiesÂ for me in Scouting or if my lack of Queen's Scout was now the cause of my feeling like I was being held back. As was pointed out thoughÂ there'sÂ always something to do at the grass roots of Scouting where the rubber really meets the road.
