A few interesting things on the way home from work today, the first was a lovely old factory, a bitÂ neglectedÂ and all but now on fire. Fire crews where there spraying water on it but it was still going when I stopped.

And as if they where sent to bring some excitement to my afternoon, some baby gooses. Yes ok their parents are violent and horrid but they still look cute.
