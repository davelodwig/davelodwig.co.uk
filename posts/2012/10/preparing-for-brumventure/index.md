It's BrumVenture this weekend and I'm hauling the tents for the kids from the 141st Birmingham to Pikes Pool. Thankfully I'd planned to take Friday off so I'm not trying to cycle there in the rush hour traffic with 5 tents and my kit.Â The photo was taken after a test run from picking the tents up from the Scout hut and cycling back home. I got quite a few weird looks but the bike towed the load like it almost wasn't there.

BrumVenture is Birmingham Scouts county badge weekend and takes place every year at our Pikes Pool campsite. You can find out more information on the Birmingham Scouts website on [this page](http://www.birminghamscouts.org.uk/brumventure.htm "BrumVenture Webpage on Birmingham Scouts").
